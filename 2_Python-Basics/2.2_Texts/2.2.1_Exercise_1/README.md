# Exercise 2.2.1: Python Texts

In this exercise, we will focus on the use and manipulation of text in Python, including printing special characters, storing text in variables, and various tools for manipulating text including:

* Using the text concatenation method
* Find the length of a text
* Changing the case of the text

## Usage

A text (also known as String) is a sequence of characters and it is considered one of the most used data types. A common characteristic of Strings is that it is immutable, meaning that once created we cannot change it. From now on we can use both terms interchangeably during this module.

The most common wat to use text in Python is to store the textual data in a variable. The next example demonstrates the creation of a new variable called ```name``` in order to store the data ```Mary```. To do this, we need to follow the next syntax:


```bash
name = "Mary"
```

Let's see another example of a phrase:

```bash
text = "Python is amazing!"
```

We can simple, use the ```text``` variable to extract the required data, for example the next script prints the name ```Mary``` on the screen.


```bash
print(name) # In this case I will print the content of the name variable
```


## Exercises

### Task 2.2.1 

Your task is to create a variable called ```city``` to store the data: ```London``` , then print the content of the ```city``` variable on the screen. 

* Your result should look like this:

```bash
London
```

### Task 2.2.2

Your task is to create two variables, the first variable to be called ```city``` and will store the data: ```Berlin``` , and the second variable to be called ```population``` and will store the data: ```3645000```. Then print the content of the ```city``` and ```population``` using a colon (```:```)  in between. 

* Your result should look like this:

```bash
London: 3645000
```

### Task 2.2.3

Your task is to create two variables, the first variable to be called ```city``` and will store the data: ```London``` , and the second variable to be called ```population``` and will store the data: ```9000000```. Then print the content of the ```city``` and ```population``` using their labels as shown in the output below.

* Your result should look like this:

```bash
City: London
Population: 9000000
```
