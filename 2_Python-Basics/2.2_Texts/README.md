# Overview

This submodule will help you learn how to work with text for programming with Python. We will explore a variety of concepts including using Strings, methods to create and manipulate Strings, ways to slice and extract substrings and the use of regular expressions.

## Objectives

By the end of this submodule, you should be able to:

* Work with Strings in Python
* Use methods to concatenate and modify Strings
* Use methods to search, replace a part of split a Python String
* Use the **re** Python library to create scripts for regular expressions
