# 2. Python Basics/2.1 Introduction

In this exercise, we will learn the use of the ```print``` Python function that will help us to output a message on the screen.


## Usage

To use the ```print``` function we will need to follow the next syntax:


```bash
print(object(s), sep=separator)
```

Let's see an example:
```bash
print(10)
```
This script will print the number ```10``` on the screen.


The parameter values include:
* object(s): Any object what we want to output on the screen, including text, numbers or variables.
* sep=separator: A way to specify how to separate objects. This is an optional parameter, and we will see examples in a while.

Note that if we want to print text on the screen we can use single or double quotes. We always need to be consistent.

Let's see an example:
```bash
print("Hi!")
```
This script will print ```Hi!``` on the screen.
