# Exercise 2.3.1

## Python Texts

In this exercise, we will focus on the use and manipulation of dates in Python, including the use of Python libraries such as datetime and date.

## Usage

Python Libraries are a set of useful functions that eliminate the need for writing codes from scratch. 

The most common way to import a library in Python is to follow the next syntax:

```
import datetime
```
